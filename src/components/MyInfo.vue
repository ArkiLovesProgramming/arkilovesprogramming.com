            <!-- - Developed third-party software access module by callaborating with team, which needs to interface with third-party applications and handle a large number of third-party application API interfaces.<br/>
            - Acquired with full-stack development skills to deal with back-end server maintenance, front-end page presentation, and manipulate database by writing sql statement.<br/>
            - Solved the problem of abnormal data structure caused by the client's version iteration and turned the manual data maintenance into an automated operation to save almost 70% labor cost by writing a java-based database operation program to automate the execution of sql.<br/>
            - updated the client data maintenance scheme from postman tool to a java-based program by proposing the idea of automatically splicing the token of a target client and calling its apiï¼Œthereby making the maintenance process easier, quicker, and more efficiently. -->
